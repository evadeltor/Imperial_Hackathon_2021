One of the most damaging effects that climate change is having is on crop yields. Extreme wether is more comon now than years ago, reason for wich due to droughts, floods, high and low temperatures there is a need to model the behaviour that we are experimenting.

#### Visualization
First of all the goal is to understand the data, for that reason we need to plot the raw data. Here we can see the timeline of the crop yields.
